    <summary><h3>Task (translation of the original)</h3></summary>

        Develop a RESTful API for task management. Use the Symfony 6 framework and the MySQL database.

        Description:
        - There are users in the system, each of whom can create, view, update and delete their tasks.
        - The task consists of the following fields: title, description, creation date, completion date, status (completed or not).
        - The system must support the following actions:
            - View a list of all the user's tasks.
            - Creating a new task.
            - View information about the task.
            - Editing a task (changing the title, description, and completion date fields).
            - Deleting a task.
            - Marking the task as completed.

        Requirements:
            - The Symfony 6 framework should be used to create an API.
            - To work with the database, use the Doctrine ORM.
            - Add user authorization using authorization tokens (JWT or other).
            - Error handling and data validation must be implemented.
            - API documentation should be available.

        Results:
            - The source code of the developed API.
            - API documentation (in English) in Markdown format, containing a description of the available routes and request parameters.

        Additional tasks (an advantage):
            - Implement pagination and sorting when requesting a list of tasks.
            - Implement the ability to add comments to tasks.
            - Write unit tests for the created controllers and services.
